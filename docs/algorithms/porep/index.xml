      <description>This section summarizes the ZigZag Commitments algorithm described in Tight PoS - ZigZag.
Graph Both renumbered (DRG) and reversed (expander) parents are generated by a pseudorandom permutation and are provided only to illustrate the nature of the zigzag commitment scheme. They accurately represent how parent-child relationships change between layers, and are accurate for expander parents. However, this is not representative of the DRG parent selection algorithm.
The following graphs illustrate how the position of challenges, DRG parents, and expander parents change between layers.</description>

      <description>This section describes the specific Proof-of-Replication (PoRep) used in Filecoin called ZigZag. In this construction, the prover encodes the original data into a replica and commits to it. An offline PoRep proves that the commitment to the replica is a valid commitment of the encoded original data.
ZigZag has been presented by Ben Fisch at EUROCRYPT19.
Introduction Background on Proof-of-Replication Proof-of-Replication enables a prover P to convince a verifier V that P is storing a replica R, a physically independent copy of some data D, unique to P.</description>
