      <description>Block miners should constantly be performing Proofs of SpaceTime using Election PoSt, and checking the outputted partial tickets to run Secret Leader Election and determine whether they can propose a block at each epoch. Epochs are currently set to take around X seconds, in order to account for election PoSt and network propagation around the world. The details of the mining cycle are defined here.
Active Miner Mining Cycle In order to mine blocks on the Filecoin blockchain a miner must be running Block Validation at all times, keeping track of recent blocks received and the heaviest current chain (based on Expected Consensus).</description>
