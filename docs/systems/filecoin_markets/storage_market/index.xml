      <description>The StorageClient is a module that discovers miners, determines their asks, and proposes deals to StorageProviders. It also tracks deals as they move through the deal flow. Note that any address registered as a StorageMarketParticipant with the StorageMarketActor can be used with the StorageClient. A single participant can be a client, provider, or both at the same time.

      <description>StorageMarketActor is responsible for processing and managing on-chain deals. This is also the entry point of all storage deals and data into the system. It maintains a mapping of StorageDealID to StorageDeal and keeps track of locked balances of StorageClient and StorageProvider. When a deal is posted on chain through the StorageMarketActor, it will first check if both transacting parties have sufficient balances locked up and include the deal on chain.</description>

      <description>The StorageProvider is a module that handles incoming queries for Asks and proposals for Deals from a StorageClient. It also tracks deals as they move through the deal flow, handling off chain actions during the negotiation phases of the deal and ultimately telling the StorageMarketActor to publish on chain. The StorageProvider&#39;s last action is to handoff a published deal for storage and sealing to the Storage Mining Subsystem. Note that any address registered as a StorageMarketParticipant with the StorageMarketActor can be used with the StorageClient.</description>
