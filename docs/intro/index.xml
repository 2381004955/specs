      <description>Filecoin Systems Status Legend:
 üõë Bare - Very incomplete at this time.  Implementors: This is far from ready for you.   ‚ö†Ô∏è Rough &amp;ndash; work in progress, heavy changes coming, as we put in place key functionality.  Implementors: This will be ready for you soon.   üîÅ Refining - Key functionality is there, some small things expected to change. Some big things may change.  Implementors: Almost ready for you.</description>

      <description>The majority of Filecoin&amp;rsquo;s user facing functionality (payments, storage market, power table, etc) is managed through the Filecoin Virtual Machine (Filecoin VM). The network generates a series of blocks, and agrees which &amp;lsquo;chain&amp;rsquo; of blocks is the correct one. Each block contains a series of state transitions called messages, and a checkpoint of the current global state after the application of those messages.
The global state here consists of a set of actors, each with their own private state.</description>

      <description>For clarity, we refer the following types of entities to describe implementations of the Filecoin protocol:
  Data structures are collections of semantically-tagged data members (e.g., structs, interfaces, or enums).
  Functions are computational procedures that do not depend on external state (i.e., mathematical functions, or programming language functions that do not refer to global variables).
  Components are sets of functionality that are intended to be represented as single software units in the implementation structure.</description>
