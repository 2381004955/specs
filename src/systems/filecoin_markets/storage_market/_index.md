{{<label storage_market>}}
Storage Market subsystem is the data entry point into the network. Storage miners only earn power from data stored in a storage deal and all deals live on the Filecoin network. Specific deal negotiation process happens off chain, clients and miners enter a storage deal after an agreement has been reached and post storage deals on the Filecoin network to earn block rewards and get paid for storing the data in the storage deal. A deal is only valid when it is posted on chain with signatures from both parties and at the time of posting, there are sufficient balances for both parties locked up to honor the deal in terms of deal price and deal collateral.

# Terminology

- **StorageClient** - The party that wants to make a deal to store data
- **StorageProvider** - The party that will store the data in exchange for payment. A storage miner.
- **StorageMarketActor** - The on-chain component of deals. The StorageMarketActor is analogous to an escrow and a ledger for all deals made.
- **StorageAsk** - The current price and parameters a miner is currently offering for storage (analogous to an Ask in a financial market)
- **StorageDealProposal** - A proposal for a storage deal, signed only by the - `Storage client`
- **StorageDeal** - A storage deal proposal with a counter signature from the Provider, which then goes on-chain.

# Deal Flow

The lifecycle for a deal within the storage market contains distinct phases:

1. **Discovery** - Client identifies miners and determine their current asks
2. **Negotiation** - Both parties come to an agreement about the terms of the deal, each party commits funds to the deal, data is transferred
4. **Publishing** - Deal is published on chain so that it becomes valid
5. **Handoff** - Once the deal is published, it is handled off the Storage Mining Subsystem, so that it can be added to sector, sealed, and proved so the miner can receive payments. 

The remaining parts of the deal lifecycle are handled by the Storage Mining Subsystem, which communicates with the Storage Market Actor in order to process deal payments. See {{<sref storage_mining_subsystem>}} for more details.

The following diagram outlines the phases of deal flow within the storage market in detail:

# Discovery

Discovery is the process where a client identifies storage providers (i.e. a miner) who might be able to store their data. There are many ways a client might identify a provider to store their data. This outlines the minimum discovery services a filecoin implementation MUST provide. As the network evolves, third parties may build systems that supplement or enhance these services.

Discovery involves identifying providers and determining their current `StorageAsk`. The steps are as follows:
1. A client queries the chain to gain a list of Storage Miner Actors who have registerd as miners with the StoragePowerActor
2. A client may perform additional queries to each Storage Miner Actor to determine their properies -- worker addresses, sector size, libp2p Multiaddress etc
3. Once the client identifies potentially suitable providers, it sends a direct libp2p message using the `Storage Query Protocol` to get each potential provider's current `StorageAsk`.
4. Miner's respond on the `AskProtocol` with a signed version of their current `StorageAsk`

A `StorageAsk` contains all the properties that a client will need to determine if a given provider will meet its needs for storage at this moment. Providers should update their asks frequently to insure the information they are providing to clients is up to date.

# Negotiation

Negotiation is how a storage client and a storage provider come to an agreement about a storage deal and reach the point where a deal is published on chain.

Negotiation begins once a client has discovered a miner whose `StorageAsk` meets their desired criteria.The *recommended* order of operations for negotiating and publishing a deal is as follows:

1. Before sending a proposal to the provider, the `StorageClient` adds funds for a deal, as neccesary, to the `StorageMarketActor` (by calling `AddBalance`)
2. In order to propose a storage deal, the `StorageClient` then calculates the piece commitment (`CommP`) for the data it intends to store ahead of time. This is neccesary so that the `StorageProvider` can verify the data the `StorageClient` sends to be stored matches the `CommP` in the `StorageDealProposal`. For more detail about the relationship between payloads, pieces, and `CommP` see {{<sref piece>}} and {{<sref filproofs>}}
3. The `StorageClient` now creates a `StorageDealProposal` and sends the proposal and the CID for the root of the data to be stored to the `StorageProvider` using the `Storage Deal Protocol`

Execution now moves to the `StorageProvider`

4. The `StorageProvider` inspects the deal to verify that its parameters match it's own internal criteria (such as price, piece size, deal duration, etc) -- and rejects the proposal if it doesn't
5. The `StorageProvider` queries the `StorageMarketActor` to verify the `StorageClient` has deposited enough funds to make the deal (i.e. balance > total storage price) and rejects the proposal if it hasn't.
6. If all criteria are met, the `StorageProvider` responds on the `Storage Deal Protocol` indicate an intent to accept the deal.

Execution now moves back to the `StorageClient`

7. The `StorageClient` opens a push request using the `Data Transfer Module`, and sends the request to the provider along with a voucher containing the CID for the `StorageDealProposal` 
8. The `StorageProvider` checks the voucher and verifies the CID matches an open proposal, and, if so, accepts the data transfer request from the `StorageClient`.
9. The `Data Transfer Module` now transfers for the data to be stored from the  `StorageClient` to the `StorageProvider` using `GraphSync`.
10. Once complete, the `Data Transfer Module` notifies the `StorageProvider`
11. The `StorageProvider` recalculates the piece commitment (`CommP`) from the data that was transferred and verifies it matches the piece commitment in the the `StorageDealProposal`

# Publishing

Data is now transferred, both parties have agreed, and it's time for the `StorageProvider` to publish the deal.

12. First, the `StorageProvider` add collateral for the deal as needed to the `StorageMarketActor` (using `AddBalance`)
13. Now, the `StorageProvider` calls `PublishStorageDeals` on the `StorageMarketActor` to publish the deal. It sends the StorageDealProposal signed by the client as well as its own signature in the message to publish the storage deal.
14. If all goes well, the `StorageMarketActor` responds with an on chain `DealID` for the published deal.
15. The `StorageProvider` responds sends a message to the `StorageClient` on the `Storage Deal Protocol` with the on chain `DealID` to indicate the deal has been accepted and published.

Finally, the client verifies the deal.

16. The `StorageClient` should query the `StorageMarketActor` with the `DealID` returned by the `StorageProvider` to get the published `StorageDeal` signed by the `StorageProvider`

# Handoff

Now that a deal is published, it needs to be stored, sealed, and proven in order for the provider to be paid. However, these components are handled by the {{<sref storage_mining_subsystem>}}. So the final task for the Storage Market is to handoff to the Storage Mining Subsystem

17. The `StorageProvider` writes the serialized, padded piece that a shared {{<sref filestore>}}. 
18. The `StorageProvider` calls `HandleStorageDeal` on the `StorageMiner` with the published `StorageDeal`.

A note order of operations: the only requirement to publish a storage deal with the `StorageMarketActor` is that the `StorageDealProposal` is signed by the `StorageClient`, the publish message is signed by the `StorageProvider`, and both parties have deposited adequate funds/collateral in the `StorageMarketActor`. As such, it's not required that the steps listed above happen in exactly the order listed above. However, the above order is *recommended* because it generally minimizes the ability of either party to act maliciously.
